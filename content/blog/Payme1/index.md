This application will allow users to view,       outstanding invoices

## Payme Team  

Employers, regardless of industry, need workers who are capable of working successfully as part of a team.
We will be 4 dedicated Web developpers to work on this project,

## Set reminders 

On my next post i will be going in deep on how to build the front-End and the Back-end parts for the reminders component.

#### REMINDERS FRONT-END

>   The Reminders will allow:
1. to view open invoices via a drop box menu
2. to set daily, weekly, monthly, or custom email and/or mobile reminders using calendar feature
3. to include personal comments or custom client messages for reminders

#### REMINDERS BACK-END 
##### Are there third party services, APIs, or platforms you will use to implement this feature?

After few days of deep researches , i came up with 3 third party APIs:
 * 1. The NEXMO Messages API allows you to send and in some cases receive messages over the following communications channels:
        * SMS/MMS 
        * Facebook Messenger
        * Viber
        * WhatsApp
    * The SendGrid v3 REST API to  send email.
    * TimerJobs is a simple way to create recurring tasks that can react to events. this Api will wrap the sms/email Apis and execute each task on a specific date chose by the user.

### Conclusion 
For conclusion-Making a project is a good way to possess knowledge. Through this way i will got to know many things during this process of building this application. And i want to thank my Team members for giving me an opportunity to work on this Payme Application, I am sure that the knowledge i will gain from this project will help me further. 

I will tried my best to make this reminders components easy and understandable, but still i apologize for any anykind of bugs or error that my occur.
